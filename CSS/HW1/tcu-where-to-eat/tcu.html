          We went on a nice quiet day.  Seating was plentiful and line wasn't very long.  Even so, parking was very scarce but it makes sense since it's on the TCU campus, and most people will be walking here.  I got the habanero burger and I added fries and a drink.  First off the fries were great.  Natural cut, nicely salted, these are my favorite kind of fries.  The burger was interesting.  The bun was very bready which I think could make some people like it and some people not like it.  My favorite part though was that the habanero sauce was not slacking.  It was real habanero level spicy and I loved it.  That's some authentic stuff and they don't even try to warn you about it.  I like that it's unapologetically true.  It was a bit pricy and overall the food wasn't as good as Five Guys although it was probably almost the same price.  They have some good fountain drink opti
